First, for the case when $P$ is coprime to $N$, because $N = pq$ and $p$ and $q$ are prime, Euler's totient function $\\varphi(N) = (p-1)(q-1)$.  Thus we can write $ed \\equiv 1 \\bmod \\varphi(N)$, or equivalently, $ed = 1 + k\\varphi(N)$ for some $k$.  By Euler's theorem, because $P$ is coprime to $N$, $P^{\\varphi(N)} \\equiv 1 \\bmod N$.

It would be understandable (though not entirely blameless) if an application that parses ASN.1 neglects to look at anything after a self-describing and self-delimiting ASN.1 packet.\n",

We use the second approach, where the key word is \"garbage.\"  We don't need to find a number that, when cubed, matches a given, entire padded signature.  Assuming that an ASN.1-parsing application does not look beyond the ASN.1 packet, the number cubed need match only up to and including the packet; the remaining bytes can be anything that makes the cube root work.  That means, at minimum, if we use only a single `0xFF` byte and SHA1 for the hash, matching just 39 bytes: the initial `0x0001FF00`, a 15-byte ASN.1 prefix, and a 20-byte SHA1 hash.

    "DSA employs randomness, but in a different way from RSA.  As we saw above, RSA encryption adds randomness in the form of random padding bytes which can be structurally identified and removed during decryption.  By contrast, DSA signing uses a per-signing random $k$ value that is directly incorporated into the mathematical computation.  Perhaps this explains why a DSA signature is a pair $(r, s)$: $k$ factors into each component (in different ways), and through a fancy verification computation $k$ is effectively factored back out.  An implication of this approach is that signing the same message with DSA results in a different signature every time."

We attempted to perform the search using integer bounds, but found that after 1,018 iterations the bounds drifted away from the solution, perhaps because enough roundoff error had accumulated to cause the bounds to deviate from the neat fractional power-of-2 subdivisions of $[0,n]$.  Using fractions instead of integers solves the problem.  Because $n$ is coprime to $2$, the bounds will always be pure fractions.  The loop terminates when the bounds differ by less than a unit, i.e., the bounds straddle the integer solution which is retrievable by taking the floor of the upper or right bound."

    "\n",
    "> **Degree of difficulty: moderate**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> These next two challenges are the hardest in the entire set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Bleichenbacher from CRYPTO '98: [Chosen Ciphertext Attacks Against Protocols Based on the RSA Encryption Standard PKCS #1](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BFb0055716.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the paper.  It describes a padding oracle attack on PKCS#1v1.5.  The attack is similar in spirit to the CBC padding oracle you built earlier; it's an \"adaptive chosen ciphertext attack\", which means you start with a valid ciphertext and repeatedly corrupt it, bouncing the adulterated ciphertexts off the target to learn things about the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common flaw even in modern cryptosystems that use RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also the most fun you can have building a crypto attack.  It involves 9th grade math, but also has you implementing an algorithm that is complex on par with finding a minimum cost spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build an oracle function, just like you did in the last exercise, but have it check for plaintext\\[0] == 0 and plaintext\\[1] == 2.\n",
    "- Generate a 256 bit keypair (that is, p and q will each be 128 bit primes), \\[n, e, d].\n",
    "- Plug d and n into your oracle function.\n",
    "- PKCS1.5-pad a short message, like \"kick it, CC\", and call it \"m\".  Encrypt to to get \"c\".\n",
    "- Decrypt \"c\" using your padding oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this challenge, we've used an untenably small RSA modulus (you could factor this keypair instantly).  That's because this exercise targets a specific step in the Bleichenbacher paper --- Step 2c, which implements a fast, nearly O(log n) search for the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things you want to keep in mind as you read the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- RSA ciphertexts are just numbers.\n",
    "- RSA is \"homomorphic\" with respect to multiplication, which means you can multiply c * RSA(2) to get a c' that will decrypt to plaintext * 2.  This is mindbending but easy to see if you play with it in code --- try multiplying ciphertexts with the RSA encryptions of numbers so you know you grok it.\n",
    "- What you need to grok for this challenge is that Bleichenbacher uses multiplication on ciphertexts the way the CBC oracle uses XORs of random blocks.\n",
    "- A PKCS#1v1.5 conformant plaintext, one that starts with 00:02, must be a number between 02\\:00:00...00 and 02\\:FF:FF..FF --- in other words, 2B and 3B-1, where B is the bit size of the modulus minus the first 16 bits.  When you see 2B and 3B, that's the idea the paper is playing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt \"c\", you'll need Step 2a from the paper (the search for the first \"s\" that, when encrypted and multiplied with the ciphertext, produces a conformant plaintext), Step 2c, the fast O(log n) search, and Step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Step 3 code is probably not going to need to handle multiple ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you just use the raw math from paper (check, check, double check your translation to code) and not spend too much time trying to grok how the math works.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Our OpenSSL-based implementation refuses to create such a small key, so we reprise our own RSA code from [challenge 39](set-5.html#Challenge-39:-Implement-RSA) in set 5, and also add support for PKCS#1 v1.5 padding."

    "## Challenge 48: Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 Padding Oracle (Complete Case)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Cryptanalytic MVP award**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is an extraordinarily useful attack.  PKCS#1v15 padding, despite being totally insecure, _is the default padding used by RSA implementations_.  The OAEP standard that replaces it is not widely implemented.  This attack routinely breaks SSL/TLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a continuation of [challenge #47](#Challenge-47:-Bleichenbacher's-PKCS-1.5-Padding-Oracle-(Simple-Case)); it implements the complete BB'98 attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set yourself up the way you did in #47, but this time generate a 768 bit modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the attack work with a realistic RSA keypair, you need to reproduce step 2b from the paper, and your implementation of Step 3 needs to handle multiple ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full Bleichenbacher attack works basically like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting from the smallest 's' that could possibly produce a plaintext bigger than 2B, iteratively search for an 's' that produces a conformant plaintext.\n",
    "- For our known 's1' and 'n', solve m1=m0s1-rn (again: just a definition of modular multiplication) for 'r', the number of times we've wrapped the modulus.\n",
    "- 'm0' and 'm1' are unknowns, but we know both are conformant PKCS#1v1.5 plaintexts, and so are between \\[2B,3B].\n",
    "- We substitute the known bounds for both, leaving only 'r' free, and solve for a range of possible 'r' values.  This range should be small!\n",
    "- Solve m1=m0s1-rn again but this time for 'm0', plugging in each value of 'r' we generated in the last step.  This gives us new intervals to work with.  Rule out any interval that is outside 2B,3B.\n",
    "- Repeat the process for successively higher values of 's'.  Eventually, this process will get us down to just one interval, whereupon we're back to exercise #47.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when we get down to one interval is, we stop blindly incrementing 's'; instead, we start rapidly growing 'r' and backing it out to 's' values by solving m1=m0s1-rn for 's' instead of 'r' or 'm0'.  So much algebra!  Make your teenage son do it for you!  \\*Note: does not work well in practice*\n",

    "All that's needed for this challenge is to set `K = 768//8` and re-run the cell above.  However, it takes order 10 minutes to complete so we omit it here."
