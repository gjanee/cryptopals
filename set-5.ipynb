Typically the client would also create and send the salt at the same time, though the salt can in principle be created by either party as long as it is shared.

SRP protects against this by incorporating $x$ into the computation of $B$ (and the client assumes that $x$ has been so incorporated, and its computation of the key and HMAC assume that this has been done)."
